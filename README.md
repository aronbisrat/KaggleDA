README.md – Predicting House Prices with XGBoost and RandomForest
roject Summary
This project explores advanced regression techniques to predict house prices using the Kaggle House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques dataset. 
The focus is on handling missing values, transforming skewed data, encoding categorical variables, and comparing model performance between XGBoost and Random Forest.

## 📌 Project Highlights

Cleaned and explored a real-world dataset with 80+ variables
- 🧹 Handled missing values using `SimpleImputer` (mean/most frequent strategy)
- 🧠 Applied **feature engineering**: log transformation and one-hot encoding
- ⚙️ Built and compared **XGBoost** and **Random Forest** regressors
- 📈 Evaluated model performance using **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- 🏅 Achieved validation MAE of **13,500**
- 🔗 Shared the full notebook and analysis on Kaggle Key Features
